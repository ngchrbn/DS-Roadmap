# 4. Applied Statistics and Mathematics

```text
Duration: 1 month (August) including a project
```

## A. Topics

- __Descriptive Statistics__ : to be able to summarize the data is powerful, but not always. Learn about estimates of location (mean, median, mode, weighted statistics, trimmed statistics), and variability to describe the data.

- __Inferential statistics__ : designing hypothesis test, A/B tests, defining business metrics, analyzing the collected data and experiment results using confidence interval, p-value, and alpha values.

- __Linear Algebra__, __Single and multi-variate calculus__ to understand loss functions, gradient, and optimizers in machine learning.

## B. Project Ideas

- Solve the exercises provided in the courses above and then try to go through a number of public datasets where you can apply these statistical concepts. Ask questions like “Is there sufficient evidence to conclude that the mean age of mothers giving birth in Boston is over 25 years of age at the 0.05 level of significance”?

- Try to design and run small experiments with your peers/groups/classes by asking them to interact with an app or answer a question. Run statistical methods on the collected data once you have a good amount of data after a period of time. This might be very hard to pull off but should be very interesting.

- Analyze stock prices, cryptocurrencies, and design hypothesis around the average return or any other metric. Determine if you can reject the null hypothesis or fail to do so using critical values.
