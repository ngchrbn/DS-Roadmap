# 5. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

```text
Duration: 3 months(September, October and November) including a project
```

## A. Topics

- __Supervised Learning__  — includes regression and classification problems. Study simple linear regression, multiple regression, polynomial regression, naive Bayes, logistic regression, KNNs, tree models, ensemble models. Learn about evaluation metrics.

- __Unsupervised Learning__  — Clustering and dimensionality reduction are the two widely used applications of unsupervised learning. Dive deep into PCA, K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and gaussian mixtures.

- __Reinforcement learning__ (can skip*) — helps you build self-rewarding systems. Learn to optimize rewards, using the TF-Agents library, creating Deep Q-networks, and so on.

## B. Project Ideas

- The majority of the ML projects need you to master a number of tasks that I’ve explained in [this blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/task-cheatsheet-for-almost-every-machine-learning-project-d0946861c6d0).
