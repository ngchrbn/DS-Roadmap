# 2. Data Collection and Wrangling (Cleaning)

```text
Duration: 2 months (April and May) including a project
```

## A. Web Scraping and APIs

### Resources

- [towardsdatascience blog about Web Scraping](https://towardsdatascience.com/byod-build-your-own-dataset-for-free-67133840dc85).

- [APIs (Dataquest tutorial)](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-api-tutorial/)

- //TODO: Add  more resources

## B. Pandas & Numpy

### Resources

- [Kaggle pandas tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas)
- [Data cleaning course by Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-cleaning)
- [FCC Course on Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib and seaborn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-uOLxNrNk8)

## C. Project Ideas

- Collect data from a website/API (open for public consumption) of your choice, and transform the data to store it from different sources into an aggregated file or table (DB). Example APIs include [TMDB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3), [quandl](https://www.quandl.com/tools/python), [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs), and so on.

- Pick [any publicly available dataset](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-repositories-for-almost-every-type-of-data-science-project-7aa2f98128b) and define a set of questions that you'd want to pursue after looking at the dataset and the domain. Wrangle the data to find out answers to those questions using Pandas and Numpy.
