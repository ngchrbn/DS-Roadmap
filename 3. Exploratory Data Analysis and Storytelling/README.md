```text
Duration: 2 months (June and July) including a project
```

## A. Topics

- __Exploratory data analysis__ : defining questions, handling missing values, outliers, formatting, filtering, univariate and multivariate analysis.

- __Data Visualization__ : plotting data using libraries like matplotlib, seabrn, and ploty. Know how to choose the right chart to communicate the findings from the data.

- __Developing dashboards__ : a good percent of analysts only use Excel or a specialized tool like Power BI and Tableau to build dashboards that summarize/aggregate data to help management make decisions.

- __Business acumen__ : Work on asking the right questions to answer, ones that actually target the business metrics. Practice writing clear and concise reports, blogs, and presentations.

## B. Project Ideas

- Exploratory anaysis on [movies dataset to find the formula to create profitable movies](https://towardsdatascience.com/hitchhikers-guide-to-exploratory-data-analysis-6e8d896d3f7e) (use it as inspiration), use datasets from healthcare, finance, WHO, past census, Ecommerce, and so on.

- Build dashboards (jupyter notebooks, excel, [tableau](https://towardsdatascience.com/hitchhikers-guide-to-exploratory-data-analysis-6e8d896d3f7e)) using the resources provided above.
